Hooray!@Are you Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy?@But you can't retire! There's evil afoot.@All I said that there was evil afoot.@Hold on. Just let me look at ya.@Do you remember the time the food supply in Atlantis was running low? So you invented a ray gun that makes things grow six times their size to shoot at the kelp gardens. But then the evil Man Ray swoops down and swipes the gun away and shoots all the algae.@And he globs onto the undersea dome.@And he starts sucking on the glass.@You guys are the greatest heroes of all time and I think you should come out of retirement.@Why are you here to rescue little ol' me?
