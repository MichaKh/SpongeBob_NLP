So without further ado let the mauling begin!@Now release the opponent.@Enough dilly-dallying.

Like that ice cream cone for instance.@You can have anything you want with a little training.@Yes. You just have to learn to be more assertive. And I can show you how.@That's right.@Wonderful.@SpongeBob don't let that guy sit on you! Assertiveness lesson #1: tell him to get off!@No no be assertive!@Not in-sertive!@SpongeBob you missed your chance! You've got to be aggressive to get the things you want!

You're just like stairs!@Okay but this is your last chance!@Look at all those beach hogs soaking up your sun rays. Do you have what it takes to get a tan?@Yes my plan is beginning to work! They're leaving the beach!@SpongeBob that was wonderful! Is that an all-over tan?@Look at that huge line at the hot dog stand. Assert yourself to the front!@SpongeBob that was genius!

I mean SpongeBob. Allow me to explain.@First we'll need a distraction inside the Krusty Krab. That's where the Identical Twin Puppies come into play.@Free from Krabs' watchful eye Acrobat Puppy can begin his infiltration.@Once Acrobat Puppy gets inside Krabs' office he'll open the window for Demolitions Puppy.@Then Demolitions Puppy will blow the safe wide open.@With the safe open the formula is mine! And finally just for fun Comic Relief Puppy adds a dollop of humor.@But it already has!@What do you think the puppies have been doing all this time? Now to open my prize!@Karen!
