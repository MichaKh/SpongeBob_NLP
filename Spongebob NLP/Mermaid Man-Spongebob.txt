We're duty-bound to help whenever it sounds.@Good boy.@Oh youth! Cut down in its prime!@Oh speak to me son.@Maybe the Conch Signal@is too much responsibility. But how would you like to spend the rest of the afternoon on patrol?@To the Invisible Boatmobile!@When you patrol in the city you'll always have to be vigilante. On your toes. Constantly alert. Always expect the unexpected.@Oh that fellow over there used to be the Atomic Flounder. I know that he doesn't look like much but he could go back to crime@just like that.@Keep looking. Diligence. Diligence.@Aha! You saved us son.@Are you up for another ride in the Invisible Boatmobile?@The Dirty Bubble popped And Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy and SpongeBob got away! Hooray!@Listen up you villains. I wanna eat my meatloaf. If you don't get out of here then by the power invested in me I now pronounce you man and wife.@You may kiss the bride!@What do you want?@Evil! Where is it?@He-he's-he's absorbing it like some kind of evil sponge!
